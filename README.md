Recce is a database reconciliation tool **_for developers_**.

It is intended to make it easier to reconcile arbitrary datasets between **source** and **target** database schemas **on an
ongoing basis** using configured SQL expressions without writing code.

You can read more about the ideas behind Recce at [DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).
